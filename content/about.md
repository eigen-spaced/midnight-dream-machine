My name is Sunny. I am primarily a full-stack developer but do more than that, including but not limited to cloud, data and ML.
I'm also a fitness freak and love cycling and am a Mexican Ground Karate practitioner.

Here I talk about a variety of topics, from programming and tech, to martial arts and my shitty takes on life.
